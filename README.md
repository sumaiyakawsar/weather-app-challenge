- [x] Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- [x] Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown 
- [x] Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- [x] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [react-loading-skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton#readme) - Used to display skeleton placeholders while content is loading, improving the user experience.
- [react-speech-recognition](https://github.com/JamesBrill/react-speech-recognition) - Provides voice input support, allowing users to search for locations or interact with the app using speech.
- gh-pages - Enables quick and easy deployment of the React app to GitHub Pages.
- [knip](https://knip.dev/) - Helps keep the codebase clean by detecting unused files, exports, and dependencies.



 ### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

 

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources
- [PWC resource](https://dev.to/hamdankhan364/simplifying-progressive-web-app-pwa-development-with-vite-a-beginners-guide-38cf) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand PWC. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
