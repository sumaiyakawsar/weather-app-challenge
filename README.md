## My process

### Built with
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [react-loading-skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton#readme) - Used to display skeleton placeholders while content is loading, improving the user experience.
- [react-speech-recognition](https://github.com/JamesBrill/react-speech-recognition) - Provides voice input support, allowing users to search for locations or interact with the app using speech.
- gh-pages - Enables quick and easy deployment of the React app to GitHub Pages.
- [knip](https://knip.dev/) - Helps keep the codebase clean by detecting unused files, exports, and dependencies.



 ### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
